# 3.0 Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory analysis was performed on the cleaned dataset to better understand the trends of different variables in our dataset. 

First, we checked the overall ratio of our target classes:

```{r target_check_fig, fig.align='center', message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results/figures/target_plot.png"))
```
<center>
Figure ... . Bar graph to check the balance in the target class. 
</center>

Next, we investigated all the predictors in the data set in relation to our target class for 100,000 crime instances. The features that were explored include: category, day of week, description, police district, time, longitude, latitude, month of report and day of report, in respect to whether the resolution of the crime instance was processed or non-processed. The features that demonstrated to be good predictors for segregrating processed from non-processed crime resolutions are shown below.



```{r data, echo=FALSE}
sf_data <- read.csv(here::here("data/clean_sf_data.csv"))

knitr::kable(head(sf_data))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
